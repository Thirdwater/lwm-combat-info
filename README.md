# Philosophy

* **The script is meant to help with combat analysis.**  
  As such, any suggestions for information you would like to see are welcome, provided they do not conflict with the philosophies below.
* **The script only uses information already given to the client.**  
  E.g. no miss/luck/morale counters, etc.  
  While those can technically be tracked or worked out from the given move history in principle, their nature is strictly outside the scope of this script.  
  Also no server requests.  
* **The script does not reveal any information that would otherwise result in an unfair advantage over their opponents.**  
* **The script tries to minimize its presence on the original combat interface.**  
  E.g. information are all presented in a tooltip much like the creature ability descriptions and does not add any extra UI footprint.
